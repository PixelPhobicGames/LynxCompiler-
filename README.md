  Limitations:
  
    Varibles:
      Varible names can only be 4 characters long 
      
    
  Programming Instructions:
  
    print                   # This will print Plain Text or Numbers not a Varible | Usage [ print Hello World ] 
    
    printv                  # This will print Varibles not Plain Text or Numbers | Usage [ printv Var1 ] 
    
    printi                  # This will print User Input | Usage [ printi Var1 ] 
    
    setcolor                # This will set the text's color | Usage [ setcolor red ] 
    
    jump                    # This will jump to a program section | Usage [ jump TESTSECTION: ]  
    
    var                     # This will set a value to a Varible | Usage [ var Var1 HelloWorld ]  
    
    getint                  # This will Get User Input | Usage [ getint Var1 ]  
    
    exit                    # This will close the Program
